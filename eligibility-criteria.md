# Eligibility Criteria

## Inclusion Criteria
- Primary studies addressing quantum-based collision avoidance in autonomous systems.
- Studies that partially or fully answer the research questions.
- Studies focusing on autonomous UAVs or, more broadly, on autonomous vehicles sharing similar computational challenges (e.g., perception, planning, decision-making).
- Studies indirectly related to collision avoidance but that integrate quantum computing into the computational pipeline with potential benefits for latency reduction and collision prevention.

## Exclusion Criteria
- Studies focused exclusively on non-UAV contexts, such as traffic signaling or infrastructure control without a multi-agent or collaborative autonomy perspective.
- Studies in which quantum technologies are applied solely to communication security or cryptography.
- Quantum-inspired approaches that do not involve genuine quantum computation.
- Studies outside the scope of autonomous systems or collision avoidance.
- Non-primary studies (e.g., surveys, books).
