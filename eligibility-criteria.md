# Eligibility Criteria

## Inclusion Criteria
- Studies addressing quantum-based collision avoidance in autonomous systems.
- Primary studies that partially or fully answer the research questions.
- Studies focused on autonomous drones or, more broadly, autonomous vehicles sharing similar computational challenges.

## Exclusion Criteria
- Studies focused exclusively on non-UAV contexts (e.g., traffic management).
- Quantum-inspired approaches (non-genuine quantum methods).
- Studies outside the scope of collision avoidance or autonomous systems.
- Non-primary studies (e.g., surveys, editorials, tutorials).
