# Search String
This study adopted a structured search strategy across three electronic databases to identify scientific articles on quantum-based 
approaches for collision avoidance in UAVs. A comprehensive search string was applied across all databases to capture a wide range 
of relevant terminology.

The search strategy was structured into **three conceptual blocks** combined using the Boolean operator AND.
- The **first block targeted quantum-related studies**. The generic term "quantum" was intentionally adopted, instead of more specific
expressions such as "quantum computing" or "quantum algorithms", to avoid overly restricting the search space and to capture a broader
range of potentially relevant studies.
- The **second block focused on collision-related concepts**, including collision avoidance, obstacle detection, conflict detection
and related planning.
- The **third block addressed autonomous and aerial vehicle systems**, encompassing UAVs, drones, autonomous vehicles, and
multi-vehicle systems.

# Databases
This study consulted the **IEEE Xplore**, **Web of Science**, and **ACM Guide to Computing Literature**, selected for their relevance and comprehensive coverage of the research topic. These sources provide broad and up-to-date access to the literature in engineering, computer science, and emerging technologies, supporting a rigorous and systematic analysis.
